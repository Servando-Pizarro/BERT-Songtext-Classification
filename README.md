 ## LLM-Songtext-Classification

This repository contains code for classifying song lyrics using a large language model (LLM). The model is trained on a dataset of over 1 million song lyrics, and can be used to classify songs into various genres, moods, and other categories.

### Prerequisites

To run the code in this repository, you will need the following:

* A computer with a GPU
* A Python environment with the following libraries installed:
    * `transformers`
    * `torch`
    * `numpy`
    * `pandas`
    * `matplotlib`
    * `seaborn`

### Data

The dataset used to train the model is available for download from the following link:

[Link to dataset]

The dataset is a CSV file containing the following columns:

* `song_id`: The unique ID of the song
* `lyrics`: The lyrics of the song
* `genre`: The genre of the song
* `mood`: The mood of the song
* `other_categories`: Other categories that the song can be classified into

### Model

The model is a transformer-based language model that is trained on the dataset of song lyrics. The model is trained to predict the genre, mood, and other categories of a song given its lyrics.

### Training

To train the model, you can use the following command:

```
python train.py --data_path /path/to/dataset.csv --output_dir /path/to/output_directory
```

The `train.py` script will train the model for a specified number of epochs. The model will be saved to the `output_dir` directory.

### Evaluation

To evaluate the model, you can use the following command:

```
python evaluate.py --data_path /path/to/dataset.csv --model_path /path/to/model.pt
```

The `evaluate.py` script will evaluate the model on the dataset and print the accuracy of the model.

### Usage

Once the model is trained, you can use it to classify song lyrics into various genres, moods, and other categories. To do this, you can use the following code:

```
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSequenceClassification

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("model_name")
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("model_name")
